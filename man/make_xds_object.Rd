\details{
This function sets up everything that is required to configure and run a basic model.

First, the function sets up some short text strings (assigned to the same \code{S3} class)
to dispatch various \strong{cases} of of various \code{S3} functions:
\itemize{
\item \emph{\code{xds}} is either "xde" for differential equations or "dts" for difference equations;
\item \emph{\code{frame}} is one of several cases:
\itemize{
\item "full" includes all three dynamical components: a human/host dynamical component, \eqn{\cal XH}; and adult mosquito dynamical component, \eqn{\cal MYZ}; and an aquatic mosquito dynamical component, and \eqn{\cal L}.
in some form (possible the trace case) (see \code{\link[=xds_setup]{xds_setup()}})
\item "mozy" is for mosquito ecology models (see \code{\link[=xds_setup_mosy]{xds_setup_mosy()}}), including models without pathogen infection dynamics in mosquitoes
\item "aquatic" is for aquatic mosquito ecology models (see \code{\link[=xds_setup_mosy]{xds_setup_mosy()}}), forced by a function describing egg laying
\item "human" is for human/host infection dynamics(see \code{\link[=xds_setup_human]{xds_setup_human()}}), forced by the infective density of adult mosquitoes, \eqn{fqZ}
\item "cohort" is for human/host cohort infection dynamics (see \code{\link[=xds_setup_cohort]{xds_setup_cohort()}}), forced by a function \code{F_eir}
}
\item \emph{\code{dlay}} is either "ode" or "dde" and it only affects dispatching for differential equations
\item \emph{\code{forcing}} is set to "static"
\item \emph{\code{compute}} dispatches various cases of \code{\link[=compute_terms]{compute_terms()}} linked to \code{frame}
}

Next, the function sets the basic \strong{structural parameters}:
\itemize{
\item \emph{\code{nVectors}} or \eqn{n_s}, the number of vector species is set to 1;
\item \emph{\code{nHosts}} or \eqn{n_i}, the number of host species is set to 1;
\item \emph{\code{nPatches}} or \eqn{n_p} is the number of patches
\item \emph{\code{nHabitats}} or \eqn{n_q} is the number of aquatic habitats is \code{length(membership)}
\item \emph{\code{nStrata}} or \eqn{n_q} is the number of human population strata is \code{length(HPop)}
}

Next, the function sets up egg laying, blood feeding, and transmission:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Egg Laying} is set up by calling \code{\link[=create_habitat_matrix]{create_habitat_matrix()}} and then \code{\link[=setup_EGG_LAYING]{setup_EGG_LAYING()}}
\item \strong{Blood Feeding} is set up by calling \code{\link[=create_residence_matrix]{create_residence_matrix()}}and then calls \code{\link[=setup_BLOOD_FEEDING]{setup_BLOOD_FEEDING()}}:
\item \strong{Transmission}  is set up by calling \code{\link[=setup_TRANSMISSION]{setup_TRANSMISSION()}} and
\code{\link[=setup_visitors_static]{setup_visitors_static()}} sets up a static model for the availability of visitors, with no visitors
}

Finally, the function sets up a few other miscellaneous options:
\itemize{
\item \link{Exposure} is called \emph{after} \link{Transmission} to compute environmentally heterogeneous exposure
and malaria importation through travel:
\itemize{
\item \code{\link[=setup_exposure_pois]{setup_exposure_pois()}} sets up a Poisson model for environmental heterogeneity
\item \code{\link[=setup_travel_static]{setup_travel_static()}} sets up a model with no exposure through travel
}
}
}
