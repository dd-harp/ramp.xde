\usage{
F_ar(eir, b, pars)
}
\arguments{
\item{eir}{the daily eir for each stratum}

\item{b}{the probability of infection, per bite}

\item{pars}{an \strong{\code{xds}} object}
}
\value{
the local ARs as a \link{numeric} vector of length \eqn{n_h =} \code{nStrata}
}
\description{
This function compute the daily
local attack rates (ARs) as a function
of the daily EIR and effects of partial immunity.
It is computed based on a probabilistic model
environmentally heterogeneous exposure.
If a model of human / host infection (\eqn{\cal X}) has terms
that describe partial immunity, \emph{e.g.} affecting
pre-erythrocytic immunity to malaria called
by \link{F_b}, those effects are implemented here.
