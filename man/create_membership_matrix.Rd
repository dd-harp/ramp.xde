\title{Create the habitat membership matrix, \eqn{\cal N}}
\usage{
create_membership_matrix(nPatches, membership)
}
\arguments{
\item{nPatches}{the number of patches}

\item{membership}{a vector describing the patch index for each habitat}
}
\value{
the habitat membership \link{matrix}, denoted \eqn{\cal N} where \eqn{\left|\cal N\right|= N_p \times N_q}
}
\description{
The habitat membership matrix, \eqn{\cal N}, holds
information about the patch location for each habitats.
Let \eqn{N_q} denote the number of habitats, \code{nHabitats},
and \eqn{N_p} the number of patches, \code{nPatches}.
If \eqn{w} is any vector describing a quantity in
habitats (\emph{i.e.}, \eqn{\left|w\right|= N_q}), then
\eqn{W={\cal N}\cdot w} is a vector that has summed \eqn{w} by patch, and \eqn{\left|W\right|= N_p}.
}
\details{
Information about the patch location of each habitat
is passed as the membership vector, an ordered list of patch locations. If
the \eqn{i^{th}} habitat is in the \eqn{j^{th}} patch, then
\eqn{{\cal N}[j,i]=1.} Otherwise, \eqn{{\cal N}[j,i]=0.}
