## Modularity

Dynamical systems models for malaria and other mosquito-borne pathogens (MBPs) are naturally modular. Transmission dynamics involve infection dynamics in populations of two different species of hosts: a mosquito host, and a human or other vertebrate animal host. Parasite / pathogen transmission occurs through blood feeding. The modular nature of these systems can be emphasized by rewriting the equations using [modular forms](modular_forms.html)

Mosquito population density is a parameter in the Ross-Macdonald model. Many dynamical systems describing transmission dynamics and control for malaria and other MBPs include equations describing mosquito ecology and population dynamics: volant adult and aquatic immature mosquito sub-populations connected through egg-laying and emergence. The equations describing these dynamics can be organized around blood feeding (for transmission) or egg-laying and emergence (for mosquito ecology). 

In simple models, the assumptions about

Dynamical systems for malaria and other MBPs have a broad set of other features: spatial dynamics; human/host demography; heterogeneous transmission; various forms of vector control; health interventions; mosquito resource dynamics; malaria importation; and exogenous forcing by weather.

In `ramp.xds,` the equations are solved by computing the terms and the derivatives separately. 

+ `Transmission(t,y,pars)` computes three terms required to compute parasite transmission during blood feeding. These are stored in the main model object `pars`:

    - `pars$beta` - a function that allocates infective bites to human strata. In this case, $\beta = 1/H$ 
    
    - `pars$NI` - a function $F_X$ computes the effective density. In this case, $F_X$ returns $cI$
    
    - `pars$fqZ` - a function $F_fqZ$ computes infective biting density 
    
    - `pars$EIR` - the daily EIR is $\beta \cdot fqZ$ 
    
    - `pars$FoI` - the daily FoI is $F_h(EIR, b, pars$Xpar)$

+ `Exposure(t, y, pars)` computes the FoI from the EIR under a model of exposure and stores it as `pars$FoI` 

So instead of developing models like `RMv1`, we have implemented the code in the syle of `RMv2`:

```{r}
RMv2 <- function(t, y, pars) {
  with(pars,{
      pars = Transmission(t, y, pars)
      pars = Exposure(t, y, pars)
      dX = dXdt(t, y, pars) 
      dY = dMYZdt(t, y, pars) 
      return(list(dX, dY))
  })
}
```



## Model building in ramp.xds

Models for mosquito borne pathogen transmission systems are naturally modular, structured by
vector life stage, host population strata, and by the spatial locations (patches) at
which transmission occurs (see figure below).

Models in the ramp.xds framework are constructed from 3 dynamical components:

  * $\mathcal M$: adult mosquitoes, whose dynamics are described by $d\mathcal{M}/dt$
  * $\mathcal{L}$: aquatic (immature) mosquitoes, whose dynamics are described by $d\mathcal{L}/dt$
  * $\mathcal{X}$: human population, whose dynamics are described by $d\mathcal{X}/dt$
  
The combined state from these 3 components is the entire state of the dynamical model, and their combined dynamics described by their differential equations represents the full endogenous dynamics of the system. In addition there are 2 more components which do not directly contribute to the state of the model, but instead modify parameters and compute intermediate quantities to represent external influences on the system. These are:

  * Exogenous forcing: weather, climate, unmodeled populations
  * Vector control: public health and mosquito control interventions which affect the dynamical components

There are also functions which handle the exchange of information (flows) between the dynamical components and which couple their dynamics. Bloodfeeding is the process by which adult mosquitoes seek out and feed on blood hosts, and results in the quantities $EIR$ (entomological inoculation rate) and $\kappa$, the net infectiousness of humans to mosquitoes, which couple the dynamics of $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{X}$. Likewise emergence of new adults from aquatic habitats and egg laying by adults into habitats couples $\mathcal{M}$ and $\mathcal{L}$. 

The function `ramp.xds::xDE_diffeqn` compute the necessary quantities and returns a vector of derivatives of all state variables which can be used to solve trajectories from a model in ramp.xds. The program flow within this function is summarized by this diagram:
